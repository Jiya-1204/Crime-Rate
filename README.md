****Project Process:****

****Data Preparation and Transformation:****


-Leveraged Power Query to clean and restructure the raw crime data for accuracy and uniformity.

**Data Model Development:**

-Constructed an efficient data model to streamline analysis.

-Built a custom date table to support temporal insights and visual breakdowns.

**DAX Metrics and Computed Fields:**

-Used Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to uncover deeper insights.

-Developed calculated columns and dynamic measures to evaluate various crime metrics.

**Report Design:**

-Assembled a detailed multi-page report with interactive dashboards.

-Integrated drill-through capabilities to allow deeper investigation by time and weekday dimensions.

**Core Analytical Insights:
Overall Crime Count:**

-Displays the total number of crimes recorded in the dataset.

**Yearly Crime Breakdown and Trends:**

-Breaks down crime data by year and visualizes year-to-year trends.

**Crimes by Time Intervals:**

-Analyzes the frequency of crimes during different time slots throughout the day.

**Weekday and Monthly Crime Patterns (Heatmap):**

-Shows the concentration of crimes across different weekdays and months using a heatmap visualization.

**Geographic Crime Distribution:**

-Looks at how crimes are distributed across various countries.

**Resolved vs. Unresolved Cases:**

-Highlights the number of cases that have been solved compared to those still open.

**Month-to-Month Crime Variation:**

-Tracks crime trends on a monthly basis, including percentage changes to capture variability.

**Most Crime-Prone Time Periods:**

-Identifies which times of the day see the highest volume of criminal activity.
